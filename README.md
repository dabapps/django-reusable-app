Overview
========

A simple template for creating reusable apps with Django.

Includes:

1. A `setup.py` that makes your life easy and doesn't suck.
2. A simple layout that lets you run the app's tests without installing it into an existing project.
3. A sample `.travis.yml` config file.

Creating a new app
==================

You'll want to clone this project, then create a fresh git repo for it:

    git clone git://github.com/dabapps/django-reusable-app.git my-project-name
    cd my-project-name
    mv myproject packagename
    rm -rf .git
    git init

Edit `testsettings.py` and update the app name in INSTALLED_APPS.
Edit `setup.py` and update the settings at the top of the file.
Edit the `README`.

Pushing releases to PyPI
========================

To register your package on PyPI:

    ./setup.py register

To publish a new version of your app to PyPI, set the `__version__` string in
your package's `__init__.py`, then run:

    ./setup.py publish

Running the tests
=================

To run the tests against the current environment:

    ./manage.py test
